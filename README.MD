## Synopsis

This app is my walk through ofh the "MemeMaker" Treehouse Android application. Users are enabled to use the camera to take photos (or use them from library) and then create text overlays on top of the photos creating a "meme" to be shared. Creating it was a great advanced lesson about the Android framework, hardware, database, and camera capabilities.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Android application development with Android Studio as a part of Code Oregon 1.0, a state partnership between Oregon and Team Treehouse to teach programming skills to Oregon citizens.

## Installation

Recommend importing into Android Studio and doing some testing before deploying.
